# Real Wizards

This is a fork of the RPotter repository but mostly for inspiration.  Most of this application is shamelessly built from AI generated code.

## Goals

1. Use the Unversal Harry Potter wands to cast spells in a video game style manner
2. Monsters will be defated by players attacking them with spells
3. New spells will be gained but it's up to the actual players to remember what they are
4. Spells have types and specific types work better against different types of monsters
5. Mostly combat based, there may be some story items in-between but it's limited.

## Research/Prior Art

- [RPotter script](https://github.com/sean-obrien/rpotter)
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
- [Game Engines](https://realpython.com/top-python-game-engines/)
- For now attempt to use [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) as it's highly story based with some combat

## Eventually, Maybe

1. Use voice-to-text to determine if the player is saying the right words
